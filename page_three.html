            <p class="heaven"><strong>The Greeks believed the exceptionally virtuous would go to a paradise called Elysium after they died.</strong> <br> </p>
            <p class="purgatory"><strong>The average person, on the other hand, would end up in a purgatory called the Asphodel Meadows.</strong> <br> </p>
            <p class="hell"><strong></strong>The truly wicked were believed to be damned to Tartarus, a black pit beneath the rest of the Greek underworld. <br> </p>
